# Python-DictionarySort
# This is a combination of multiple projects from CSC231, Introduction to Data Structures, since they all use the file named dictionary.txt, in some way or another. 
# sortDemo.py allows the user to sort through a huge bunch of data. 
# binheap.py, a data structure implementation which allows to both enqueue and deque items in O(log n).
# AVLtree.py, binarySearchTree.py, testing.py implements AVL and Binary Search trees data structures. testing.py compares between the time it takes to search a word in a given list, against AVL or BinarySearch tree using Big-O algorithms.
# aqueue.py, deque.py, and test_Queue_Deque.py tests a FIFO data structure, or First In First Out.
# node.py is the building block of a linked list implementation.
# treeNode.py is an implementation of a tree node data structure, with functions about root, leaf (no children), left children, and right children.

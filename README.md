# Python-Dictionary
# This is a combination of multiple projects from CSC231, Introduction to Data Structures, since they all use the file named dictionary.txt, in some way or another. I apologize if the title of this repository is a little misleading; it is not related to hashtables.
# This program allows the user sort through a huge bunch of data.
